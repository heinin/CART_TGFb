# TGFb expression in GBM tumors

This workflowr project contains the single-cell RNA-seq analysis of GBM tumors.

1. [Feature expression across cell types in CR/SD and PD](plot_features.html)\
2. [Ligand-receptor analysis for CR/SD and PD](plot_cellchat.html)\
3. [Analyzing immune lineages by TGFb status](analyze_compartments.html)\


### To do

- GSEA for gene set signatures\
- Differential enrichment of gene sets between TGFb high and low\
- TGFb from TF (C1, D0), continuous variable analysis\
