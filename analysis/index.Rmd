# TGFb expression in GBM tumors

This workflowr project contains the single-cell RNA-seq analysis of GBM tumors.

1. [Feature expression across cell types in CR/SD and PD](plot_features.html)\
2. [Ligand-receptor analysis](plot_cellchat.html)\


### To do

- GSEA for gene set signatures\
- Differential enrichment of gene sets between PD and CR/SD\
